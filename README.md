## DataStructures
Java Implementations of following
* Doubly Linked List
* Binary Search Tree
* UnionFind - Disjoint set.
  * Quick Find
  * Quick Union
  * Weighted Quick Union
* Stack
  * Using Linked List
## Algorithms
* Based on UnionFind DataStructure. 
  * Percolation
  * Triplets Red Black Tree
* Based on Stack
  * Queue using two stacks
* Sorting
  * Selection sort
  * Insertion sort
  * Merge sort
  * Shell sort
  * Quick sort
* Shuffle 
  * This is shuffle implementation generates a random permutation of the given array.
  * One of the use-case of this shuffle algorithm is in Quick sort to get good performance. 

## Math implementations
* isPrime - Recursive and Iterative
* decimal to binary conversion - recursive
